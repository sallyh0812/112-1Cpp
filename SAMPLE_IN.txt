A New York City Jewish bakery was vandalized on Friday afternoon, after someone spray-painted "Free Gaza" on the window, before smashing a window at a nearby bank.
         The graffiti on the front window of Breads Bakery near Sixth Avenue and 49th Street appeared in bright-orange lettering.
Additional photos show a man sweeping up broken glass in front of the Simon & Schuster building, where another window, this time 
belonging to the First Republic Bank, appeared to have been smashed.The protest slowed traffic to a trickle on a bridge connecting Boston to Cambridge, and 
people in the group were seen holding signs that read, "Let Gaza Live," before unfurling a banner across the roadway that read, "Jews say: Ceasefire now."
       The night before, a violent protest of pro-Palestinian supporters erupted outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C.,
 with demonstrators growing violent as they called for an immediate cease-fire in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
      The FDA said it is still working with Dollar Tree to get the recalled products off of shelves in several states.
                          "This product should not be available for sale and consumers should not purchase or consume this product," the agency said.
  Parents should dispose of the pouches by emptying the contents into the trash and discarding
